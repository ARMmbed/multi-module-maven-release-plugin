Usage
-----

Add the plugin to your pom:

    <build>
        <plugins>
            <plugin>
                <groupId>${project.groupId}</groupId>
                <artifactId>${project.artifactId}</artifactId>
                <version>${project.version}</version>
                <configuration>
                    <releaseGoals>
                        <releaseGoal>deploy</releaseGoal>
                    </releaseGoals>
                </configuration>
            </plugin>
        </plugins>
    </build>

And then call the plugin with a build number:

	mvn releaser:release -DbuildNumber=1234

You can omit the build number in order to use a number based on the current date:

    mvn releaser:release

Running a partial release
-------------------------

It is possible to release a single module (and any modules it depends on) by using the `modulesToRelease` parameter.
For example:

	mvn releaser:release -DbuildNumber=1234 -DmodulesToRelease=MyApp

In this case the `MyApp` module will be built, released and tagged. If MyApp depends on another module, than that module will
also be built and released (but there will be no Git tag for this).
