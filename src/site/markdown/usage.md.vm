Usage
-----

Add the plugin to your pom:

    <build>
        <plugins>
            <plugin>
                <groupId>${project.groupId}</groupId>
                <artifactId>${project.artifactId}</artifactId>
                <version>${project.version}</version>
                <configuration>
                    <releaseGoals>
                        <releaseGoal>deploy</releaseGoal>
                    </releaseGoals>
                </configuration>
            </plugin>
        </plugins>
    </build>

And then call the plugin:

	mvn releaser:release

You can also optionally supply your own build numbers if you do not want an automatically incrementing number:

    mvn releaser:release -DbuildNumber=1234

Running a partial release
-------------------------

It is possible to release a single module (and any modules it depends on) by using the `modulesToRelease` parameter.
For example:

	mvn releaser:release -DmodulesToRelease=MyApp

In this case the `MyApp` module will be built, released and tagged. If MyApp depends on another module, than that module will
also be built and released (but there will be no Git tag for this).

Note that this is not generally required as the plugin will only deploy changed modules by default anyway.
